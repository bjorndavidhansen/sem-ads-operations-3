\# Google Ads Automation Tool \- Mission Statement

\#\# Core Mission  
\*\*To transform Google Ads management from tedious execution to intent-driven automation, saving advertisers significant time through modular operations that understand what they want to accomplish, not just what buttons to press.\*\*

\#\# Guiding Principles

1\. \*\*Intent Over Instructions\*\*    
   We interpret what advertisers want to achieve rather than requiring them to specify every step.

2\. \*\*Modular by Design\*\*    
   We solve specific, high-value operational challenges one at a time rather than attempting to replace the entire Google Ads ecosystem.

3\. \*\*Scale Beyond Limits\*\*    
   We enable operations at volumes that would be impossible or impractical to accomplish manually.

4\. \*\*Time is the Ultimate Value\*\*    
   Every feature must demonstrably save significant time for our users compared to existing approaches.

5\. \*\*Trust Through Validation\*\*    
   We provide confidence in automation through comprehensive previews, validations, and rollback capabilities.

\#\# Decision Framework

When evaluating new features or operations, we will ask:

1\. Does this align with our intent-driven approach?  
2\. Does this represent a discrete, high-value operation that fits our modular design?  
3\. Does this save significant time (target: 80% reduction) compared to current methods?  
4\. Does this enable scale beyond what's currently possible with existing tools?  
5\. Can we implement this in a way that users can trust and verify?

If the answer to any of these questions is "no," we should reconsider the feature or adjust its implementation to align with our core mission.

\#\# What We Are and Are Not

\*\*We are:\*\*  
\- An automation tool for specific, time-consuming Google Ads operations  
\- A bridge between advertiser intent and technical execution  
\- A productivity multiplier for Google Ads professionals

\*\*We are not:\*\*  
\- A replacement for the entire Google Ads interface or Google Ads Editor  
\- A general-purpose marketing tool or comprehensive account management system  
\- An attempt to automate all aspects of Google Ads management

Our success will be measured by the time we save advertisers, the scale we enable them to manage, and their confidence in executing operations that were previously cumbersome or impossible.
