\#\# Google Ads Automation Tool

\#\#\# 1\. Introduction  
The Google Ads Automation Tool is a desktop application designed to streamline and automate complex, time-consuming Google Ads management tasks. The application will provide a modular framework for executing common "operations" that typically require significant manual effort in the standard Google Ads interface or Google Ads Editor.

\#\#\# 2\. Problem Statement  
Google Ads professionals managing large accounts (100,000+ products, multiple campaigns) face significant workflow inefficiencies:  
\- Standard Google Ads interface is clunky and slow for bulk operations  
\- Google Ads Editor, while better for bulk edits, has volume limitations and requires repetitive manual processes  
\- Common operations (like duplicating and modifying campaigns) can take half a day or more  
\- Current tools don't understand advertiser intent, requiring precise step-by-step commands rather than goal-oriented instructions  
\- Search term analysis tools rely on lexical matching rather than understanding advertiser intent

\#\#\# 3\. Target Users  
\- \*\*In-house digital marketers\*\* managing large e-commerce accounts (100,000+ products)  
\- \*\*Agency professionals\*\* handling multiple large Google Ads accounts  
\- \*\*PPC specialists\*\* who need to execute complex operations efficiently  
\- Users who are familiar with Google Ads management but want to reduce time spent on repetitive tasks

\#\#\# 4\. Product Goals  
1\. Reduce time spent on common Google Ads operations by 80%  
2\. Enable management of larger campaign sets than Google Ads Editor permits  
3\. Create an intent-driven interface that understands what the user wants to accomplish  
4\. Build a modular framework that can be expanded to handle various operation types  
5\. Integrate LLM capabilities to enhance search term analysis and other operations  
6\. Provide a more intuitive user experience than existing tools

\#\#\# 5\. Success Metrics  
\- Time saved per operation (target: 80% reduction)  
\- User satisfaction scores (target: 90%+ satisfaction)  
\- Number of campaigns that can be processed simultaneously (target: 3x Google Ads Editor)  
\- Error reduction in campaign management (target: 50% fewer errors)  
\- Adoption rate among test users (target: 70% continued use after trial)

\#\#\# 6\. Core Use Case: Campaign Clone Operation  
The initial focus will be on implementing the "Campaign Clone Operation" which includes:  
1\. Selecting multiple exact match search campaigns  
2\. Duplicating them with modified names (replacing "Exact" with "Broad")  
3\. Converting all keywords in the duplicated campaigns from exact match to broad match  
4\. Adding all exact match keywords as negative keywords to the broad match campaigns  
5\. Ensuring search terms are directed to the appropriate campaign type

\#\#\# 7\. MVP Features

\- Automated naming convention application  
\- Match type conversion (exact to broad)  
\- Negative keyword implementation  
\- Progress visualization  
\- Success/failure reporting

\#\#\#\# 7.5 Operation Validation  
\- Pre-execution validation  
\- Change preview before commitment  
\- Undo/rollback capability

\#\#\# 8\. Future Operations (Post-MVP)  
\- Intent-based search term analysis  
\- Budget allocation optimization  
\- Ad copy generation and testing  
\- Landing page analysis and recommendations  
\- Competitor analysis  
\- Campaign structure recommendations  
\- Performance anomaly detection

\#\#\# 9\. Technical Requirements

\#\#\#\# 9.1 Performance  
\- Handle 100+ campaigns simultaneously  
\- Complete the Campaign Clone Operation in under 5 minutes for 50 campaigns  
\- Support accounts with 100,000+ keywords

\#\#\#\# 9.2 Reliability  
\- Graceful handling of API rate limits  
\- Automatic retry mechanism for failed operations  
\- Data validation before submission

\#\#\#\# 9.3 Security  
\- Secure storage of API credentials  
\- No persistent storage of account data  
\- Compliance with Google Ads API terms of service

\#\#\#\# 9.4 Compatibility  
\- Windows and macOS support  
\- Compatible with current Google Ads API version  
\- Adaptable to API changes

\#\#\# 10\. Dependencies and Constraints  
\- Google Ads API access and quotas  
\- Authentication requirements  
\- Rate limiting considerations  
\- Feature limitations of the Google Ads API  
\- LLM API costs and quotas

\#\#\# 11\. Assumptions  
\- Users have appropriate Google Ads API access  
\- Users understand basic Google Ads concepts and terminology  
\- The Google Ads API will continue to support the operations we need  
\- Operations will continue to be relevant as Google Ads evolves

\#\#\# 12\. Risks and Mitigations  
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |  
|------|--------|------------|  
| Google Ads API changes | High | Modular design, monitoring API changes |  
| Rate limiting | Medium | Intelligent batching, progress saving |  
| Authentication complexity | Medium | Streamlined auth flow, clear documentation |  
| User error | Medium | Preview features, confirmation steps, rollback |  
| Performance with large accounts | High | Optimized processing, background operations |

\#\#\# 13\. MVP Timeline
