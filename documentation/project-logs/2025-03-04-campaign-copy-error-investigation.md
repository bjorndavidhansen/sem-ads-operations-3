# Campaign Copy Operation Error Investigation

## Issue Summary
**Date:** 2025-03-04
**Component:** Campaign Clone Operation - copyCampaign method
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** Critical
**Impact:** Blocks implementation of core campaign cloning functionality

## Error Details
After multiple implementation attempts of the copyCampaign method, we encountered:
1. Initial internal errors with limited diagnostic information
2. Current error: "protocol error: incomplete envelope: unexpected EOF"

## Root Cause Analysis
The "incomplete envelope" error suggests premature connection termination, potentially caused by:
1. Network timeout or connection interruption
2. Malformed request payload
3. API version mismatch
4. Rate limiter configuration issues
5. Token refresh/authentication problems

## Implementation History
1. First Attempt:
   - Basic implementation with rate limiter
   - Result: Internal error with limited details
   
2. Second Attempt:
   - Added operation tracking integration
   - Result: Similar internal error
   
3. Current Attempt:
   - Enhanced error handling and diagnostics
   - Result: New error revealing protocol issues

## Action Items
- [ ] Implement enhanced request/response logging
- [ ] Verify API endpoint and payload format
- [ ] Review rate limiter settings
- [ ] Add connection timeout handling
- [ ] Document findings in error handling guide

## Technical Details
### Current Configuration
```typescript
// Rate Limiter Settings
maxConcurrent: 5
requestsPerMinute: 3000
minDelay: 100
retryAttempts: 3
initialBackoff: 1000
maxBackoff: 60000

// API Version: v15
// Endpoint: campaigns:mutate
```

### Diagnostic Approach
1. Add detailed request logging
2. Implement response stream monitoring
3. Track token refresh events
4. Monitor rate limiter queue state

## Next Steps
1. Implement enhanced diagnostic logging
2. Test with reduced concurrency
3. Verify payload against API documentation
4. Document findings and update error handling guide

## Success Criteria
- Successful campaign copy operation
- Complete operation tracking
- Proper error handling with recovery
- Documentation updated with findings

## Updates
