\# Google Ads Automation Tool \- App User Flow

\#\# Overview

This document outlines the primary user flows through the Google Ads Automation Tool application, with special focus on the MVP Campaign Clone Operation. The flows are designed to address the pain points identified in our user personas while delivering the benefits outlined in our product documentation.

\#\# 1\. Application Entry & Authentication Flow

\#\#\# 1.1 Initial Launch Experience  
1\. User launches the desktop application  
2\. System displays welcome screen with:  
   \- Application overview and benefits  
   \- Sign-in button  
   \- Version information

\#\#\# 1.2 Authentication Process  
1\. User clicks "Sign in with Google"  
2\. System opens OAuth authentication flow in default browser  
3\. User authorizes application access to their Google Ads account(s)  
4\. System receives and securely stores OAuth tokens  
5\. User is returned to application with authenticated session

\#\#\# 1.3 Account Selection  
1\. System displays list of available Google Ads accounts  
2\. User selects one or more accounts to work with

\#\# 7\. Critical Paths & Success Metrics

\#\#\# 7.1 MVP Critical Path  
The minimum viable path through the application is:  
1\. Launch → Authentication → Account Selection  
2\. Dashboard → Campaign Clone Operation  
3\. Campaign Selection → Basic Configuration  
4\. Validation → Execution → Results

This path must be optimized for:  
\- Speed (80% time reduction vs. manual process)  
\- Reliability (\>99% completion rate)  
\- Usability (minimal training required)

\#\#\# 7.2 Success Metrics Collection Points  
The application will collect metrics at these key points:  
1\. \*\*Authentication:\*\* Success rate, time to complete  
2\. \*\*Campaign Loading:\*\* Time to load, number of campaigns  
3\. \*\*Operation Configuration:\*\* Time to configure, options selected  
4\. \*\*Execution:\*\* Duration, completion rate, error frequency  
5\. \*\*Results:\*\* Changes made, system performance metrics  
6\. \*\*User Feedback:\*\* Optional feedback prompt after operation

\#\# 8\. Future Flow Expansions (Post-MVP)

\#\#\# 8.1 LLM-Powered Search Term Analysis  
1\. User selects "Search Term Analysis" operation  
2\. User provides parameters and intent description  
3\. System leverages LLM to analyze search terms  
4\. System presents insights and recommendations

\#\#\# 8.2 Custom Operation Builder  
1\. User selects "Create Custom Operation"
